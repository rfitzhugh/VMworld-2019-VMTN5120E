# Terraforming Your World (VMTN5120E)

There are so many options for managing an infrastructure once provisioned, but how do we provision that infrastructure in the first place? The will introduce you to Terraform, walk through a first Terraform configuration, and give examples of how the tool could be used. Learn how to define what resources you need and let Terraform do the rest.


Code and slides in repo. This is from session VMTN5120E at VMworld Barcelona 2019.
